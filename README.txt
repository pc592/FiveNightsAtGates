(*
engine.ml is essentially the updateState from the design doc
userInput.ml is userInput
AIs holds AI algorithms

convention:
use snake case for functions.
use camel case for variables and types.

notes for implementation:
doorStatus in state should be (bool*bool)
time should be (int)
battery should be (int)
view should be (string) of room
level should be (int)
click is probably (x*y)?
